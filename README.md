# OpenProject Recurring Tasks Scheduler

**A dead-simple external scheduler for OpenProject recurring tasks.**

OpenProject has [no built-in support for recurring work packages](https://community.openproject.org/work_packages/36463) for 5 years since suggested. This lightweight and dockerized tool bridges that gap by running externally and triggering OpenProject API calls using cron expressions you define.

Supports optional OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication (e.g. Keycloak). Use at your own risk if exposing the panel without proper access control.

Please take into account that the development of this tool was fueled by anger by not having such a basic feature as recurring work packages available.

---

## Features

- Define recurring tasks using cron syntax (e.g. `0 15 * * *`)
- OIDC login support (e.g. Keycloak, Auth0, ADFS)
- Rich markdown support for task descriptions
- Assign tasks to users

## ðŸ›  Usage

1. Visit the dashboard.
2. Create a new task:
   - Provide a **title**, **cron expression**, **project**, **user**, and **optional description**.
   - Cron format is standard 5-part: `minute hour day month day-of-week`
3. The task will auto-schedule and create OpenProject work packages at the specified intervals.

> You can edit, suspend, resume, or delete existing scheduled tasks directly from the dashboard.

If you use it and care enough, please make a screenshot of the interface and PR it.

## Authentication Notes

- If `OIDC_ENABLED=true`, the app enforces OpenID Connect login.
- If `OIDC_ENABLED=false`, **no authentication is applied**. Anyone with access to the web UI can use your API key.
  - Protect the interface using a reverse proxy with access controls.
